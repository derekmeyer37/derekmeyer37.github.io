## Bio
Hello! I am a dedicated biostatistician with a passion for unraveling the complexities of health data. I graduated from Brigham Young University with a bachelor's degree in Biostatistics, where I honed my skills in data analysis and statistical modeling. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in biostatistics at the University of Utah, further expanding my expertise in this dynamic field. Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in multiple research assistant positions, allowing me to gain valuable experience in applying statistical methodologies to real-world problems. One of my notable achievements includes my contribution to the development of epiworldR, an R package aimed at facilitating epidemiological research. Moreover, I am thrilled to be part of cutting-edge research projects, actively collaborating on research papers within my field. Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my work and interests!
